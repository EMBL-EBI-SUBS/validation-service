== v2.25.1 Release Notes

Bugfix:
---------
1. When a user wanted to delete an element of their Draft stated submission they failed. The element could not be deleted. The problem was that some data transfer object missed their no argument constructor, so they were not serialisable. This has been fixed.

== v2.25.0 Release Notes

New features:
---------------
1. Add possibility to search referenced samples outside of DSP. Previously samples could be only referenced if they were submitted via DSP.
2. Allow to have duplicates in sample relationships. This change makes the submission a bit more user-friendly.

Platform upgrades:

1. DSP's Validation Service now runs on Java 11 (Open JDK 11).
