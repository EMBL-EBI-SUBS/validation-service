# Schema Validator
This package contains the schema validator. This validator works as a middle layer between a Node.jsÂ® server that is the 
actual validation executor and the Submissions validation infrastructure. For more details on the JSON Schema 
Validator see its GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/EMBL-EBI-SUBS/json-schema-validator).
